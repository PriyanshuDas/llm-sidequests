# 🎹 YouTube Section Looper (AI-Generated Side Project)

This is a simple web app that lets you loop a specific section of a YouTube video by providing the start and end time (in `mm:ss` format). It’s ideal for musicians, especially pianists, who want to repeatedly practice a specific section of a tutorial or performance.

## 🔧 How It Works

Paste in a YouTube URL, specify start and end times, and the embedded player will loop just that section until you stop it. There's also a dark mode toggle for night-time jamming.

It uses:
- The YouTube IFrame API
- Basic JavaScript + DOM manipulation
- A single HTML file with embedded CSS and JS

## 💡 Why This Exists

I wanted to loop sections of piano tutorials on YouTube to practice more efficiently. Doing it manually with the keyboard and mouse was annoying and interrupted flow. I could’ve searched for some extensions or apps, but honestly — it took less time to ask an AI to help build it.

## ⚡️ Built With Help from AI

Yes — this project was built in under **2 minutes** with the help of a large language model (ChatGPT-4). I prompted it with:

> “Any way to use JavaScript to loop over a YouTube section for piano practice?”

It didn’t just give me code — it gave me a full working example with explanations, which I then adapted slightly and added a dark theme toggle.

## 🎯 Use Case

- Practicing tricky passages in piano tutorials
- Looping ear training exercises
- Repeating specific phrases from language learning videos
- Basically any case where you want YouTube to behave more like a musical loop pedal

## 🛠 Roadmap (if I keep going)

- Put on github.io for easy access
- Multiple loop section presets
- Hotkey controls (space = pause/play, R = reset to start)
- Mobile responsiveness
- Save your last video/section in localStorage

## 🚀 Live Demo

You can [clone this repo](#) and just open the `youtube-looper.html` file locally — no build tools or deployment required.

## 🧠 License / Ethos

This is a totally open and free side project. Feel free to copy, remix, or build on top of it. Just be honest about how you made it, and maybe leave a credit for the AI and your own curiosity — that combo’s the real author here.
