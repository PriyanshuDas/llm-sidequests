# 🧪 LLM Lab

A personal repo of experiments, tools, and one-off hacks built with the help of large language models (like GPT-4).

I use this to:

- Learn faster by building instead of Googling
- Turn "I wish this existed" ideas into code in minutes
- Keep track of small projects, playgrounds, and utilities

Every project is:
- Self-contained
- Fully open-source
- Often built in under 15–30 minutes

## 🧰 Projects

### 📹 youtube-section-looper
Loop a specific section of a YouTube video — perfect for musicians practicing tricky segments.

More coming soon...

## ⚡️ Built With AI Help

I use ChatGPT and similar models as a coding assistant. Where possible, I document the exact prompts or iterations in each project's README.
